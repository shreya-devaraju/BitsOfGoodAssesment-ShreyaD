        <h2>Major: Computer Science</h2>
        <h3>Year: Third</h3>
        <p>
            Hi! My name is Shreya, a third year computer science major from Cumming, Georgia. I'm particularly passionate about playing the piano, both to get my mind relaxed throughout the day
            and so I can give music back to others. Throughout highschool, in particular, I prepared songs such as <i>The Pink Panther, Hedwig's Theme, and more</i> 
            to perform for seniors at a local senior home in Roswell near important holidays like Labor Day, Christmas and several other times throughout the year.
